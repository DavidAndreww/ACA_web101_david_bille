                <div class="date">July 19<em>th</em>, 2019</div>
                <div class="content">In this post I will share what knowledge I have regarding CSS display and the various values and uses of each. You'll have a better understanding of how they differ, and when it is best to use each to achieve your desired outcome. I briefly talk about preprocessors and the advantages and disadvantages that they offer in writing CSS. You'll also gain some knowledge about stacking context and how you can use both Z-index and opacity to better stack images front to back on your webpages.</div>

                <div class="date">July 17<em>th</em>, 2019</div>
                <div class="content">This post consists of information to help lay out the flow of a page, and improve your ability to position elements and content exactly where you want it. Using floats is a basic, but valuable tool to be able to know how to use. In addition to floats, clears can also be used to assist you in aligning content along a row more easily. This post also covers how to use the SRCSET attribute to adjust the images used in your page, depending on the size of the screen height and width, and is a useful tool to have when making your pages responsive for varying sizes of screens. </div>

            <div class="date">June 30<em>th</em>, 2019</div>
            <div class="content">In this post I talk a little bit more about methods you can use to lay out the content on your page. I'll discuss box sizing and the differences between border:box and content-box, resetting and normalizing CSS and the box model. All are pretty straight forard concepts, but can save you a lot of headache and really facilitate laying out all the content within your page. I also breifly touch on the use of Google Fonts to find the perfect font style to give your page some character and a life of its own.  </div>

                <div class="date">June 23<em>rd</em>, 2019</div>
                <div class="content">The third week of class we delved into the power that is CSS Grid and Flexbox. Both are powerful tools which can serve to help you lay the foundation and general setup of your page, with absolute ease. We also learned about the position property and how it can help you make minute tweaks and adjustments to any element on your page, allowing you to place it perfectly. Lastly, I discuss Media Query, and how important it is to be able to build a webpage that fits perfectly on any type of screen size, allowing you to optimize your content for whatever device it may be viewed on.</div>

        <div class="content">This second week of class has been a little bit more of a test. We have started to work on our own personal web pages including main landing page, resume and blog page. Trying to organize and layout the page as I have displayed it on my wireframe is not always as straight forward as it appears in the blueprint of my mind. This post will briefly discuss some of the methods I have recently learned to help in structuring a page and ensuring that all of the boxes and elements are behaving as intended.</div>

        <div class="date">June 7<em>th</em>, 2019</div>
        <div class="content">The very first day of class, we were already learning how CSS worked. Having barely touched on the key elements to begin an HTML document, we were already tackling a major language that has a very significant impact on what users see on the front end. Type, Attributes, Id, Class and Pseudo-class...the 5 selectors that make CSS do what it does. We also learned about Git and GitHub, the tools that allowed for the projects from our local machines to be shared across the web. Not only share our projects and designs, but allow other developers to collaborate with us from anywhere in the world.</div>
