                <div class="content">The third week of class we delved into the power that is CSS Grid and Flexbox. Both are powerful tools which can serve to help you lay the foundation and general setup of your page, with absolute ease. We also learned about the position property and how it can help you make minute tweaks and adjustments to any element on your page, allowing you to place it perfectly. Lastly, I discuss Media Query, and how important it is to be able to build a webpage that fits perfectly on any type of screen size, allowing you to optimize your content for whatever device it may be viewed on.</div>

        <div class="content">This second week of class has been a little bit more of a test. We have started to work on our own personal web pages including main landing page, resume and blog page. Trying to organize and layout the page as I have displayed it on my wireframe is not always as straight forward as it appears in the blueprint of my mind. This post will briefly discuss some of the methods I have recently learned to help in structuring a page and ensuring that all of the boxes and elements are behaving as intended.</div>

        <div class="heading">CSS and Git: The Crash Course</div>
        <div class="date">June 7<em>th</em>, 2019</div>
        <div class="content">The very first day of class, we were already learning how CSS worked. Having barely touched on the key elements to begin an HTML document, we were already tackling a major language that has a very significant impact on what users see on the front end. Type, Attributes, Id, Class and Pseudo-class...the 5 selectors that make CSS do what it does. We also learned about Git and GitHub, the tools that allowed for the projects from our local machines to be shared across the web. Not only share our projects and designs, but allow other developers to collaborate with us from anywhere in the world.</div>
